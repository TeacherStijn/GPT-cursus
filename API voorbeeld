Plz make JS call code that sends input of a html field to an API in the POST body. Also add a application type header. Make sure the response of the API is shown as an alert to the end user. The POST body should have this data:

{
     "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
     "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Say this is a test!"}],
     "temperature": 0.7
   }

Where 'content' should contain the input from the text field
